Priority
-------------

Show less boilerplate code in the documentation
replace copying raw data during adaptation (all of the Marshal#load/#unload calls) with simply testing that modification never happens in order to increase performance?



# todo - incorporate cuke_modeler extensions from other projects

Backlog
-------------

Include comments in the string output of a feature file

replace joined array source text with single string source text/heredocs
unit testing around parsing/modeling cases (whitespace, indentation, minimalistic feature elements, etc.)
replace "\n" usages with the currently set record separator (i.e "\$" )
make sure that all classes and tests are covered and attaches to code coverage
